I try to make a Terminal Pokedex

## Rough Idea

1. Create Empty Canvas as Matrix
2. put Text on it
3. put image on it(fix width)

## Feature List

* Automatic size depending on Content(level and description)
    * fixed width
    * fixed Image size
* Image and description based on generation and game version
